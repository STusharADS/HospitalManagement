📱 Vision Assistance App: Empowering Independence
This app empowers visually impaired individuals to navigate the world independently using AI-powered object detection, haptic feedback, and emergency features. 🚀

✨ Key Features:

🔍 Object Detection & Distance: Real-time object recognition using the camera, with distance feedback via vibration. Household items and faces are accurately identified. A 3x3 grid helps pinpoint object location.
🎛️ Interactive Controls: On-screen buttons provide detailed object descriptions, emergency call functionality, and customizable options for voice commands, saving object details, adjusting vibration, and toggling features. Physical button shortcuts are also available.
🚨 Accident Detection & Alerts: GPS for navigation and location tracking. Fall detection triggers automatic emergency alerts with location and medical information (stored at startup) sent to hospitals and family.
🔧 Additional Features: Voice assistance, configurable grid system (3x3 or 2x4), AI-powered object recognition, offline functionality, and customizable vibration patterns.
