📱 Vision Assistance App: Enabling Independence
This innovative app empowers visually impaired individuals to navigate their surroundings independently through AI-driven object detection, haptic feedback, and emergency support. 🚀

✨ Key Features:
🔍 Object Detection & Distance: Utilizes the camera for real-time object recognition, providing distance feedback via vibrations. Accurately detects household items and faces, with a 3x3 grid system to indicate object location.

🎛️ Interactive Controls: Offers on-screen buttons for object descriptions, emergency calls, and customizable settings such as voice commands, object storage, vibration intensity, and feature toggles. Physical button shortcuts are also supported.

🚨 Accident Detection & Alerts: Integrated GPS enables navigation and real-time location tracking. Fall detection automatically sends emergency alerts with the user's location and stored medical details to hospitals and family members.

🔧 Additional Features: Includes voice assistance, configurable grid layouts (3x3 or 2x4), AI-powered object recognition, offline functionality, and customizable vibration feedback.
